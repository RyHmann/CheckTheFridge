Test Concept for an Ingredient Focused Recipe Book Web Application

This rough, proof of concept for a web application utilzing a back end made up of ASP.NET Framework and SQL Server, with a front end of Razor Pages. This purpose of this project was to learn ASP.NET, MVC design patterns, and strengthen my grasp of SQL.

As stated above, this is a rough proof of concept. A lot of the boiler plate ASP.NET front end was left in place with minimal error-handling. After achieving this 'skeleton' state, my goal was to push on towards learning Angular for the front end and Entity for the back end.
